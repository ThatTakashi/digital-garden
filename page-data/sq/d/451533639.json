This does not start the music playing.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.play()\n\nStart the playback of the music stream\nplay(loops=0, start=0.0) -> None\n\nThis will play the loaded music stream. If the music is already playing it will be restarted. The loops argument controls the number of repeats a music will play. play(5) will cause the music to played once, then repeated five times, for a total of six. If the loops is -1 then the music will repeat indefinitely.\n\nThe starting position argument controls where in the music the song starts playing. The starting position is dependent on the format of music playing. MP3 and OGG use the position as time (in seconds). MOD music it is the pattern order number. Passing a startpos will raise a NotImplementedError if it cannot set the start position\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.rewind()\n\nrestart music\nrewind() -> None\n\nResets playback of the current music to the beginning.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.stop()\n\nstop the music playback\nstop() -> None\n\nStops the music playback if it is currently playing.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.pause()\n\ntemporarily stop music playback\npause() -> None\n\nTemporarily stop playback of the music stream. It can be resumed with the pygame.mixer.music.unpause() function.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.unpause()\n\nresume paused music\nunpause() -> None\n\nThis will resume the playback of a music stream after it has been paused.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.fadeout()\n\nstop music playback after fading out\nfadeout(time) -> None\n\nThis will stop the music playback after it has been faded out over the specified time (measured in milliseconds).\n\nNote, that this function blocks until the music has faded out.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.set_volume()\n\nset the music volume\nset_volume(value) -> None\n\nSet the volume of the music playback. The value argument is between 0.0 and 1.0. When new music is loaded the volume is reset.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.get_volume()\n\nget the music volume\nget_volume() -> value\n\nReturns the current volume for the mixer. The value will be between 0.0 and 1.0.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.get_busy()\n\ncheck if the music stream is playing\nget_busy() -> bool\n\nReturns True when the music stream is actively playing. When the music is idle this returns False.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.set_pos()\n\nset position to play from\nset_pos(pos) -> None\n\nThis sets the position in the music file where playback will start. The meaning of “pos”, a float (or a number that can be converted to a float), depends on the music format. Newer versions of SDL_mixer have better positioning support than earlier. An SDLError is raised if a particular format does not support positioning.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.get_pos()\n\nget the music play time\nget_pos() -> time\n\nThis gets the number of milliseconds that the music has been playing for. The returned time only represents how long the music has been playing; it does not take into account any starting position offsets.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.queue()\n\nqueue a music file to follow the current\nqueue(filename) -> None\n\nThis will load a music file and queue it. A queued music file will begin as soon as the current music naturally ends. If the current music is ever stopped or changed, the queued song will be lost.\n\nThe following example will play music by Bach six times, then play music by Mozart once:\n\n```python\npygame.mixer.music.load('bach.ogg')\npygame.mixer.music.play(5)        # Plays six times, not five!\npygame.mixer.music.queue('mozart.ogg')\n```\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.set_endevent()\n\nhave the music send an event when playback stops\nset_endevent() -> None\nset_endevent(type) -> None\n\nThis causes Pygame to signal (by means of the event queue) when the music is done playing. The argument determines the type of event that will be queued.\n\nThe event will be queued every time the music finishes, not just the first time. To stop the event from being queued, call this method with no argument.\n\n---\n\n### pygame.mixer.music.get_endevent()\n\nget the event a channel sends when playback stops\nget_endevent() -> type\n\nReturns the event type to be sent every time the music finishes playback. If there is no endevent the function returns pygame.NOEVENT."},{"fields":{"slug":"/20 - 29 Project Management/21 Past Projects/21.01 Python-Music-Player/Python-Music-Player/","title":"Python Music Player"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: \"Python Music Player\"\ntags:\n- Project\n- School\n- PRG\n---\n\n## Brief:\n\nCreate a simple python music player that can control music and have music added to it via importing files.
