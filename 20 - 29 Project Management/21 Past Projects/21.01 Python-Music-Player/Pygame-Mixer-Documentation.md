### pygame.mixer.music.load()

Load a music file for playback
load(filename) -> None
load(object) -> None

This will load a music filename/file object and prepare it for playback. If a music stream is already playing it will be stopped. This does not start the music playing.

---

### pygame.mixer.music.play()

Start the playback of the music stream
play(loops=0, start=0.0) -> None

This will play the loaded music stream. If the music is already playing it will be restarted. The loops argument controls the number of repeats a music will play. play(5) will cause the music to played once, then repeated five times, for a total of six. If the loops is -1 then the music will repeat indefinitely.

The starting position argument controls where in the music the song starts playing. The starting position is dependent on the format of music playing. MP3 and OGG use the position as time (in seconds). MOD music it is the pattern order number. Passing a startpos will raise a NotImplementedError if it cannot set the start position

---

### pygame.mixer.music.rewind()

restart music
rewind() -> None

Resets playback of the current music to the beginning.

---

### pygame.mixer.music.stop()

stop the music playback
stop() -> None

Stops the music playback if it is currently playing.

---

### pygame.mixer.music.pause()

temporarily stop music playback
pause() -> None

Temporarily stop playback of the music stream. It can be resumed with the pygame.mixer.music.unpause() function.

---

### pygame.mixer.music.unpause()

resume paused music
unpause() -> None

This will resume the playback of a music stream after it has been paused.

---

### pygame.mixer.music.fadeout()

stop music playback after fading out
fadeout(time) -> None

This will stop the music playback after it has been faded out over the specified time (measured in milliseconds).

Note, that this function blocks until the music has faded out.

---

### pygame.mixer.music.set_volume()

set the music volume
set_volume(value) -> None

Set the volume of the music playback. The value argument is between 0.0 and 1.0. When new music is loaded the volume is reset.

---

### pygame.mixer.music.get_volume()

get the music volume
get_volume() -> value

Returns the current volume for the mixer. The value will be between 0.0 and 1.0.

---

### pygame.mixer.music.get_busy()

check if the music stream is playing
get_busy() -> bool

Returns True when the music stream is actively playing. When the music is idle this returns False.

---

### pygame.mixer.music.set_pos()

set position to play from
set_pos(pos) -> None

This sets the position in the music file where playback will start. The meaning of “pos”, a float (or a number that can be converted to a float), depends on the music format. Newer versions of SDL_mixer have better positioning support than earlier. An SDLError is raised if a particular format does not support positioning.

---

### pygame.mixer.music.get_pos()

get the music play time
get_pos() -> time

This gets the number of milliseconds that the music has been playing for. The returned time only represents how long the music has been playing; it does not take into account any starting position offsets.

---

### pygame.mixer.music.queue()

queue a music file to follow the current
queue(filename) -> None

This will load a music file and queue it. A queued music file will begin as soon as the current music naturally ends. If the current music is ever stopped or changed, the queued song will be lost.

The following example will play music by Bach six times, then play music by Mozart once:

```python
pygame.mixer.music.load('bach.ogg')
pygame.mixer.music.play(5)        # Plays six times, not five!
pygame.mixer.music.queue('mozart.ogg')
```

---

### pygame.mixer.music.set_endevent()

have the music send an event when playback stops
set_endevent() -> None
set_endevent(type) -> None

This causes Pygame to signal (by means of the event queue) when the music is done playing. The argument determines the type of event that will be queued.

The event will be queued every time the music finishes, not just the first time. To stop the event from being queued, call this method with no argument.

---

### pygame.mixer.music.get_endevent()

get the event a channel sends when playback stops
get_endevent() -> type

Returns the event type to be sent every time the music finishes playback. If there is no endevent the function returns pygame.NOEVENT.
