## Inquiry Focus
Design and create a mobile app to help my dad track and organize his bike mechanic repair jobs.

## Inquiry Question
How can I improve the speed at which my dad can work with the use of a digital outcome? What is causing slow downs with my dads work and what could a digital outcome do to help change this?

## Analysis
From my research, I can tell that there is quite the variation in the offerings from each different company. Each have their own pros and cons. Here I want to go through and analyze each piece of software and pick out different things that would make my digital outcome better for my stakeholder.

### Base Requirements:
In terms of my digital outcome I have a few base requirements that will need to be met in order for my outcome to be successful. They are:

**Simplicity**
- The app must be as simple to operate as my stakeholder is not very good with technology

**Speed**
- My app should be fast. My stakeholder ends up with a lot of active jobs at once. The app should be able to handle all of these while remaining fast.
- The app should have a very fast way of adding jobs to the list. I want as little friction as possible with adding tasks to the app.

**Usability**
- I want my app to feel as familiar as possible for the end user. I know that my stakeholder uses an android phone and thus my design mockup has been designed by using components from the [Material design 3](https://m3.material.io/) library. These components are likely familiar to android users.

These requirements are essential to creating an app that my stakeholder will actually want to use. Following these are also needed to make my app easy to use and instantly understandable.

### What I found from my research?:
Each app that I researched has its own pros and cons as well as a "thing" that it is best at. I conducted this research so that I could find any apps that matched my base requirements as well as I wanted to look for anything that these apps do that I could take inspiration of to improve my own app.

For each app that I conducted research on, I made an effort to be as nit picky as possible. I tested two apps that are meant for general task management and I tested two apps that are made specifically for mechanics. I want to see if the apps that are built for mechanics match my base requirements better than the general purpose apps.

#### General Purpose apps:
The two apps that I tested in this category are **Monday.com** and **Asana**. Each of these apps have vast feature sets that can cater to many different workflows. This makes each one very easy to use for businesses in many different fields. Despite their large feature set, this can also be their downfall. The large feature set can be overwhelming for new users and navigating through each feature can be painful. Each feature takes time to learn to use and most mechanics are not technically inclined and thus this will be overwhelming for them. Many workers want something that just works out of the box and that requires very little tweaking to work correctly in their workflow.

#### Mechanic Focused apps:
