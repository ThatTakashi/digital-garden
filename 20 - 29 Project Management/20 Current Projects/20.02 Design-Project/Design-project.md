## Brief:

### What am I creating?:
My plan is to design and create all the relevant designs and graphical material for both my upcoming game as well as my own game studio behind the game.

This will provide me with plenty of work for my boards as well as heaps of material for designing the website and advertising for my game.

### What style am I basing my designs off of?:
My game is a stylized [[notes/30 - 39 Topics/36 Fiction/36.01 Cyberpunk|Cyberpunk]] styled game and it takes place many years in the future. So that means lots of neon and technology. I want to create a game where each level has its own feel and atmosphere.

My game also will take heavy inspiration from [[notes/30 - 39 Topics/30 World/30.01 Japan|Japan]] design and culture. Japanese design is often mixed in with the cyberpunk design style. I also want to bring some Japanese design elements into the designs for my game studio.
